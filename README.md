# RavendbProofer
For developers like me who have used SQL database management systems for more than 20 years, 
switching to document-based and other No-SQL databases could be a nightmare. However, these databases
have major advantages over SQL databases when we are in domain-driven design territory.  
So my colleagues and I decided to start an open source project to test some leading document-based 
databases like RavenDB and learn all the features we need to know in real-world projects.
